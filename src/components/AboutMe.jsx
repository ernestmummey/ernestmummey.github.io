                Growing up I loved to see how things worked. As a kid I took apart my motherâ€™s appliances to include her toaster and microwave trying to figure out how they operated or if I could repair it. This mentality eventually led me to put together my first vehicle in high school. After serving 5 years in the military, I realized I no longer enjoyed what I was doing, and I knew it was time to change. I then found programming. My curiosity drove me to wanting to understand more, soon I was reading and watching videos about it daily. I quickly realized that I found my passion again.
                <br/>
                Programming allows me to go beyond my imagination, add creativity, and truly let me dive into understanding how everything works. I took a leap of faith and decided to go all in and join Coding Dojo bootcamp. There I was able to work in teams and collaborate with my fellow classmates and be able to help others. This bootcamp taught me 3 full stacks in three months. These stacks include Python, MERN, Java, allowing me to build several projects using different technologies.
